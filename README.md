Here we present the different codes used to produce the different results for the paper.

The Data Preparation codes are(in causal order): Wiki Extraction - Definition Filtering.

The Data Conversion to Network and its Semantic Vectors Production are: Convert Definitions to Symmetric Network - RIM.

A code with just the OD's logic is given: OD's.

The results production for the paper is found in: Pipeline of Cosine\SOD Similarity and SN vs SP SOD Comparison.

The code to create the analysis results is: Results Analysis.

The code was written in its entirety by the author alone. An AI tool (ChatGPT) was used to do two tasks a posteriori on the original code: 
  1) Rename and optimize functions as to be more easily understood by the user; 
  2) Code Documentation, to provide better comments/explanations as to what does what.
